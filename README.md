Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange

This project demonstrates the Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) — one of the most fundamental algorithms in modern cryptography. It allows two parties to securely generate a shared secret key over an insecure public channel without ever transmitting the secret itself.

The shared key generated through Diffie–Hellman can be used for encrypting and decrypting messages, enabling secure communication between parties.

## 🔐 What is Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange?

The Diffie–Hellman algorithm, introduced in 1976, solves the problem of secure key distribution.
It allows two users to agree on a secret encryption key, even if an attacker is listening to the entire conversation.

It works using:

Modular arithmetic

Prime numbers

Primitive roots

The difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)

The algorithm is secure because:

Even if public values are visible to everyone,

The private values remain secret,

Computing the shared key without the private values is computationally infeasible.

## ⚙️ How the Algorithm Works
Step 1 → Public Parameters

Both parties agree on:

A large prime number (p)

A primitive root modulo p (g)

These values are public.

Step 2 → Private Keys

Each user picks a private number:

Alice picks a

Bob picks b

These are never shared.

Step 3 → Public Keys

Each user computes:

Alice computes A = gᵃ mod p

Bob computes B = gᵇ mod p

They exchange A and B publicly.

Step 4 → Shared Secret Key

Each user calculates:

Alice computes S = Bᵃ mod p

Bob computes S = Aᵇ mod p

Both values of S are equal.

✔ FINAL RESULT → Both get the same shared secret key.

This shared key can now be used for:

AES encryption

Secure communication

Message authentication
